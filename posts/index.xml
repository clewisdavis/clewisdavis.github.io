      <description>I am starting to see some parallels between writing and drawing. When I sketch an idea, it’s very rough and unrefined. The initial sketch is never the final product—I have to get it out and keep refining. I sketch again and again until I get the final result, even then it feels unfinished. The most difficult part is deciding when to stop.
This has changed my mindset and approach to writing.</description>
